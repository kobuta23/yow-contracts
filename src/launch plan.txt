First off, deploy $YOINK on degenChain

$YOINK is a pureMintable(Burnable)SuperToken

We will initially retain admin powers, and mint a bunch of tokens to our own account.

We'll use a mix of yoinkV1 and yoinkV2
- the contract from yoinkV2
- the UI from yoinkV1

We'll need to add the right branding to the yoinkV1 UI 

We then deploy $YOINK (or someone does) on degenChain
And launch it on Farcaster
--> this is enough to win the grant

Ideally, we also orchestrate a streamed airdrop to 100 accounts (yoink users + streamYoink users)

We make a post which promises roadmap, utility, and "trust me it's deflationary"

Then we refine the game, and figure out how to launch it...


wishlist for the game:
1. A slightly improved winning condition (use constant speed but you win by having the largest flowrate for 24 "total" hours)
2. Enough data to show users if they need to topup their wallet
3. Potentially a bot that replies to the battle post, alerting users to topup before liquidation
4. Potentially a global bot which announces new battles in the yoink channel (or somewhere else)
